# Virtual Land Manager

A decentralized application (dApp) for buying and selling virtual land parcels as NFTs on the Stacks blockchain. This project was built to demonstrate core concepts of Clarity smart contracts, frontend integration with Stacks.js, and deployment to a live test network.

## Features

* **NFT Representation**: Each land parcel is a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) defined in a Clarity smart contract.
* **Decentralized Marketplace**: A marketplace smart contract handles the escrow, listing, and purchasing of land NFTs.
* **Wallet Integration**: Users can connect their Leather (formerly Hiro) wallet to interact with the dApp.
* **Dynamic UI**: The frontend, built with Next.js and React, fetches and displays live data from the deployed smart contracts on the blockchain.
